# TT-Assignment-Manager
## About TT
`tt` is a lightweight CLI assignment management tool. It allows for assignments and project deadlines to be viewed and edited directly using a command line interface. This is a small project I am developing to help me manage my work during my fourth year. I found bloated calender apps to be too much of a hassle to use and wanted a quick way to see my outstanding assignments when on my laptop. This seemed like the obvious solution as it could easily be implemented into my laptop's CLI.
